# Predicting live table tennis scores based on the sequence of scoring

The problem that we are attempting to solve is based off of an observation that the live betting lines in table tennis do not seem to account for the momentum of the players. For example, if two players are tied 7-7, and player 2 scored the prevoius 4 points, we hypothesize that they will disproportionately win the set because they score in clusters. This is an ongoing project.

We used JavaScript, Django, and two sofascore APIs to get data for 4.5 million table tennis points in PostgreSQL. We then converted the data into a csv file and are preparing to analyzing the data.
